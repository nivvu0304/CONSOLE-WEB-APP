        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is an source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.</p>
        <p>You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>
